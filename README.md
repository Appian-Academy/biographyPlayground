## Summary:

Using Swift Playgrounds students will create various `variables` and `constants` that describe themselves and their programming partners. Students will showcase knowledge of `variables`, `constants`, and basic `data types`.

Tell us about yourself and your programming partner!

## Instructions:

Create a new Swift Playground named `biographyPlayground`. Within this playground file, use comments and your programming skills to accomplish each of the tasks below. You and your programming partner should have your own versions of this playground. Good luck! You got this.

## How do I create a Swift Playground?

To create a swift playground we start with opening the application xCode. Navigate to the top menu bar and select `File` → `New` → `Playground`


Choose a `Blank` starting point


Choose where you want it to be saved. We recommend using a file structure that you can refer back to find your previous work. Here is a basic folder structure you can use.

## // Lets write some code!

1. Write a comment that describes the difference between a `var` and a `let`.
2. Write 3 `variables` and 3 `constants` that describe you.
3. Write 3 different `variables` and 3 different `constants` that describe your programming partner.
4. Use `String Concatenation` to write a sentence that describes your hobbies.
    1. Please `print` this to the console.
5. Use `String Concatenation` to write a sentence that describes your partners' hobbies.
    1. Please `print` this to the console.
6. Use `String interpolation` to write a paragraph that describes yourself using the `variables` and `constants` that you just created.
7. Use `String interpolation` to write a paragraph that describes your programming partner using the `variables` and `constants` that you just created.
8. Create a `variable` or `constant` for each of the `data types` we covered today. Comment under each `var/let` with what it is and why you choose that `data type`.
9. Party! Great work. Be sure to give the Alpha Challenges a try.

### Alpha challenges:

What are the Alpha Challenges? The Alpha Challenges are **`optional`** tasks that will challenge you and push your skills to the next level. Throughout the course, you will need to use all available resources, such as Google, Stack Overflow, and the Stateful community, to solve these.

- Use `mathematical operators` to figure out your `age`from your `birthdate`.
- Use the `Array` data type to group your hobbies into a `collection`.
- Write a paragraph that describes the difference between `Floats`, `Doubles`, and `Ints` using `String Interpolation`.
