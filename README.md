# Biography Playground


## Summary: 
Using Swift Playgrounds students will create various `variables` and `constants` that describe themselves and their programming partners. Students will showcase knowledge of `variables`, `constants`, and the basic `data types`.

Tell us about yourself and your programming partner!

## Instructions:
Create a new Swift Playground named `biographyPlayground`. Within this playground file, use comments and your programming skills to accomplish each of the tasks below. You and your programming partner should have your own versions of this playground. Good luck! You got this. 

## //TODO: â€” 

1. Write a comment that describes the difference between a `var` and a `let`.
2. Write 3 `variables` and 3 `constants` that describe you.
3. Write 3 different `variables` and 3 different `constants`that describe your programming partner.
4. Use `String Concatenation` to write a sentence that describes your hobbies.
    1. Please `print` this to the console.
5. Use `String Concatenation` to write a sentence that describes your partners' hobbies.
    1. Please `print` this to the console.
6. Use `String interpolation` to write a paragraph that describes yourself using the `variables` and `constants` that you just created.
7. Use `String interpolation` to write a paragraph that describes your programming partner using the `variables` and `constants` that you just created.
8. Create a `variable` or `constant` for each of the `data types` we covered today. Comment under each `var/let` with what it is and why you choose that `data type`. 
9. Party! Great work. Be sure to give the Alpha Challenges a try.
